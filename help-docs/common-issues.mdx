## Your account has been Disabled

- Your account has been disabled or suspended by Panora due to a violation of our Terms of Service or because your account is on a blacklist.
- If you believe this was a mistake, you can appeal your account status by visiting [app.panora.cc/account](https://app.panora.cc/account).
