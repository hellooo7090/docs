        <br />
        | Variables     | Description                                    |
        |---------------|------------------------------------------------|
        | `{user}`      | Mentions the user executing the command        |
        | `{avatar}`    | Displays the user’s avatar URL                 |
        | `{username}`  | Displays the user’s username                   |
        | `{server}`    | Displays the server name                       |
        | `{channel}`   | Mentions the current channel                   |
        | `{&role}`     | Dynamically mentions a role                    |
        | `{#channel}`  | Dynamically mentions a channel                 |

      <Tab title="Arguments">
        You can use **Arguments** to reference specific inputs provided when running a command. These placeholders allow you to dynamically insert user-provided values into messages.
        <br />
        To use them, simply include `{args#}` in your command's description. This can be done as many times as needed to structure responses dynamically.
        <br />
        Check the **Examples** tab for more details on how arguments work in practice!

## Session Logic  

### Execution & Permissions  
- **Role-Based Access:** Only users with the assigned **Allowed Roles** can execute session commands.  
- **Channel Targeting:** Messages are sent to the **configured channel**, ensuring proper visibility.  
- **Embed Customization:** If enabled, announcements will use an embed layout for better presentation.  

### Error Handling  
- If a session command is triggered with an invalid configuration, Panora notifies the user with an error message.  
- If an issue occurs with fetching roles, channels, or user details, the system retries up to three times before failing gracefully.  

### Summary  
The **Session Commands Module** in Panora streamlines the process of scheduling and managing sessions within your Discord server. Customize placeholders, control access, and ensure smooth communication for all session-related activities.
