## Member Counter Logic

### Goals and Updates
- **Automatic Goal Adjustment:** When the member count meets or exceeds the goal, Panora increases the `{goal}` by the defined `{increment}` value (default: 50) and sends a goal achievement message.
- **Embed Option:** Enable the `embed` setting to send updates in embed format for a polished presentation.
- **Operations:** The Member Counter runs every minute to check the member count and send updates, if needed, to your Discord server.

### Error Handling
- If Panora encounters an issue with fetching the member count, it retries up to three times with a short delay, ensuring updates continue even if network issues occur.

### Summary
The Member Counter feature in Panora allows for seamless tracking of your Roblox groupâ€™s growth within your Discord community. Customize messages and goals to keep members engaged and informed about your group's progress.
